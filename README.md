# Programing4all
A block programming application using Unity Game Engine. This is a group project for my Software Engineering course.

# Progress
**In developing**

Although this is a group project, it has been changed mostly to one-man-working since the last 1/3 period of the semester. 
So the progress now is still in working on the user interface. The program excuting process has not worked yet.

Big apologize to teacher and TAs :bow:

# Requirements
## To access and execute the scripts
- The latest release version of Unity 

(The Unity will take time to automatically update necessary packages to the project)

# User interface guide
## Overview
![](/README_resources/UIScreen.jpg)
The interface includes 4 main fields:
- Tool Box
- Syntax Box
- Editing Box
- Terminal

## Tool Box 
![](/README_resources/ToolBoxImage.jpg)
You can perform several UI actions on the *Tool Box*
- File handling
- Documentation
- Running/Pausing program
- Undo/Redo actions
- Exit the application
### File handling
By clicking the *File* button, the drop down list of file actions will be displayed, and you can start opening, saving or closing their file.

**Note:** I have not finished the file handling functions, so there will be nothing if you click on these buttons.

### Documentation
If you want to open documentations of this application, then just need to click on the *Documentation* button.

### Runing/Pausing program
- To start executing the program, you need to click on *Run* button.
- To pause the program, you need to click on *Pause* button.
- If you want to run the program step by step, then you can click on *Run by step* button which is right next to the *Pause* button.

### Undo/Redo
Clicking on the *Undo* and *Redo* buttons to undo and redo your actions.

### Exit the application
If you want to exit out of the application, you can click on the *Exit* button on the top right corner.

### Syntax Box and Editing Box
Here are the fields where you can perform dragging and dropping your block programming.

The *Syntax Box* is where I store necessary syntax blocks for programming.
On the *Syntax Box* there is a red block which is my demo block.

You can hold your click on the block then drag and dop onto the "Editing Box" in which your program will be generated to code for interpreting.

### Terminal
You can read your output result on the *Terminal*, which is the black field on downer corner of your screen.

However, beacuse our project has not finished yet, there won't be no displayed result.
